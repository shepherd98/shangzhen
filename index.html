    <p>I’m in my final year as a Master in Nuclear Science and Technology, where I have been working in the lab of Prof. Jiejuan Tong at Tsinghua University, China. I received my Bachelor's degree in Nuclear Engineering and Technology from the School of Energy and Environment， Southeast University, China, in 2020. I’m planning to apply to Ph.D. programs in 2023 Fall, and I’m very interested in the possibility of joining your group with top-level academics.

    <h3>RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h3>
    <li>
        Developed and proposed two evolutionary algorithm models that can reconstruct a 3-D gamma dose rate field using sparse and arbitrarily-positioned measurements, achieving relative error less than 5% with experimental cases
    </li>
    <li>
        Modified Cahn-Hilliard equation and TV-H-1 models to extend 2-D radiation field inversion into 3-D gridding reconstruction
    </li>
    <li>
        Programmed to process 3-D radiation images, with Image Inpainting, Image Denoising, and Reconstruction codes
