    Contact: zhusz20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn
    <p>I’m in my final year as a Master in Nuclear Science and Technology, where I have been working in the lab of Prof. Jiejuan Tong at Tsinghua University, China. I received my Bachelor's degree in Nuclear Engineering and Technology from the School of Energy and Environment， Southeast University, China, in 2020. I’m planning to apply to Ph.D. programs in 2023 Fall, and I’m very interested in the possibility of joining your group with top-level academics.
